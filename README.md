# Computer Graphics - Rendering Engine Coursework (2020)
(Graded at 80%)

## General
This project uses the C++ OpenGL library to create an advanced 3D graphics rendering engine from scratch, capable of rendering soft shadows, complex materials (mirrors, glass), and perspective corrected texture mapping.

A sample video is given below (480p).
